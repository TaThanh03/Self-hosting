# Prelude

This **journal** folder will contain my thought journey,  
and this is the **first part** of that journey.

## Why I Start This

I have too many complaints about my current state of development.  
I want to learn new "things" ‚Äî for my personal growth and professional development.  

But I don‚Äôt have a lot of time, because I prioritize my family. I have kids to care for, to spend time with.  
Still, I feel like I‚Äôm stuck. Dependent on all the big-tech services that I use.  
I want to take back control.

## My View on Technology

A lot of new technology will come in the future.  
Your life will be dependent on it ‚Äî which in turn can make your life better ‚Ä¶ or worse, if you don‚Äôt understand the **core** of it.  

So you have to be constantly learning.  
Be prudent, be responsible for the technology you use.  

And the best way to achieve this goal is **self-hosting**.  
Not just for me, but also for other people.

## What is "Self-Hosted Man"?

‚ÄúSelf-hosted man‚Äù is a hard achievement.  
The only way to reach it is to be very, very organized:  
- decompose the challenge into small, solvable parts  
- keep it ergonomic and suitable for my living style  

I will move slow, but with consistency and a firm, well-defined direction.  

To achieve this, I need a way to organize and decompose tasks.  
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm treating this like a **project**:  
- I create issues  
- I commit regularly  
- I track progress  

I act as my own project manager, my own boss, and my own worker.

## Achievements Must Feel "Sweet"

Each small objective should be **rewarding**.  
So I have to define the achievement and goal clearly, and make them feel ‚Äúsweet.‚Äù  

For example:  
- Hosting my first doc site is not just a technical step.  
- It will also serve as my **living CV** ‚Äî a portfolio that grows as I learn.  

Yes, it‚Äôs a hard way to build a CV‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs worth it!  
Because every milestone is both a **skill gained** and a **tangible result** I can show.

## My Philosophy (in brief)

I will yap more in depth about my ‚Äú5 cents philosophy‚Äù another time.  
But in short ‚Äî what is self-hosting?  
üëâ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)

In my opinion, it is the best way to be the **master of your virtual life**.  

- Be your own server.  
- You will learn a *shit load* of things.  
- Everything you learn will be valuable.  
- There are so many benefits.

## My First Step

My first step will be to **Host My First Doc Site**.  
- First, it will be on the cloud.  
- Then, I will migrate it to my self-hosted server (Raspberry Pi).

## A Simple Sketch of My Journey

Think of this journey like reading a **book**.  

- Each **Part** is a new big service I want to learn and self-host (like a doc site, a password manager, or a personal cloud).  
- Each **Chapter** is a smaller step: first I try it in the cloud, then I migrate it to my own server.  

So **Part 1** will be:  
- **Chapter 1**: Deploy a simple documentation site on a free cloud server.  
- **Chapter 2**: Deploy the same documentation site on my Raspberry Pi at home.  

That‚Äôs where my story begins.
