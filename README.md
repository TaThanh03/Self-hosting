# 🏡 Self-Hosting Journey

This repository is my **public learning journey into self-hosting**.  
It is both a **technical project** and a **personal notebook**: a place where I define roadmaps, track progress, and write down my thoughts and philosophy.

## 🎯 Objectives

### 1. Project Management
- Define a **clear roadmap**: chapters, parts, and milestones.  
- Set **objectives** for each step (what to deploy, which skills to gain, which tools to use).  
- **Track progress** transparently: Issues, tasks, checklists, and “Done” criteria.  
- Treat self-hosting as a **real project**: reproducible steps, documented results, continuous improvement.  

### 2. Personal Documentation
- A place to **write down my thoughts and reflections**:
  - daily/weekly notes on what I learned, what failed, and what worked.  
  - my philosophy around decentralization, DIY mindset, and digital ownership.  
- A **living notebook**: Markdown notes → built into a static site (MkDocs).  
- Share my **ideas, reasoning, and personal philosophy** alongside technical tutorials.

## 📈 Long-Term Goals
- Build a **self-hosted personal infrastructure** (portfolio site, password manager, cloud storage, media server, etc.).  
- Learn **by doing**: Linux, Docker, networking, security, automation, and backup strategies.  
- Contribute **back to the public**: share guides, configs, and tools so others can reproduce my steps.  
- Transform this repo into a **living CV**: proof of skills, evolution, and personal contributions.

## 🛤️ Principles
1. **Reproducibility**: everything is documented with small scripts and minimal commands.  
2. **Iteration**: each chapter is self-contained (e.g., Doc site, Password Manager, Personal Cloud).  
3. **Transparency**: both successes and failures are valuable and will be documented.  
4. **Philosophy + Tech**: not just *how to install*, but also *why this matters*.
